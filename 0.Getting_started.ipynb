    "Alternative to vector data are raster data. In its simplest form, a raster consists of a matrix of cells (or pixels) organized into rows and columns (or a grid) where each cell contains a value representing information. In a more complex form, raster data can have multiple layers where each layer again represents information.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Data/images/raster_data_simple.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In raster datasets, each cell (which is also known as a pixel) has a value of digital number. The cell values represent the phenomenon portrayed by the raster dataset such as a category, magnitude, or spectral value. The category could be a land-use class such as grassland, forest, or road. A magnitude might represent temperature, or surface elevation above mean sea level. Spectral values are used in satellite imagery and aerial photography to represent light reflectance and color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell values can be either positive or negative, integer, or floating point. Integer values are best used to represent categorical (discrete) data and floating-point values to represent continuous surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area (or surface) represented by each cell consists of the same width and height and is an equal portion of the entire surface represented by the raster. For example, a raster representing elevation (that is, digital elevation model) may cover an area of 100 square kilometers. If there were 100 cells in this raster, each cell would represent 1 square kilometer of equal width and height (that is, 1 km x 1 km).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension of the cells can be as large or as small as needed to represent the surface conveyed by the raster dataset and the features within the surface, such as a square kilometer, square foot, or even square centimeter. The cell size determines how coarse or fine the patterns or features in the raster will appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of each cell is defined by the row or column where it is located within the raster matrix. Essentially, the matrix is represented by a Cartesian coordinate system in image space, in which the rows of the matrix are parallel to the x-axis and the columns to the y-axis of the Cartesian plane. Row and column values typically begin with 0. These Cartesian coordinates then correspond to real world coordinates in a certain projection system which typically is called a Coordinate Reference System (CRS). There exist many CRS which all serve different purposes and you can find an overview on [https://spatialreference.org/](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/)\n",

Native JPEG, TIFF, and PNG files do not have georeferenced information associated with them and therefore cannot be used in any geospatial mapping efforts as they only exist in image space and not in coordinate space.\n",
